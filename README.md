# es-categorizer 
Extracting categories from an arbitrary block of text using elasticsearch.

### How?

Given some text, [term vectors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-termvectors.html) and the [OpenNLP Ingest Processor plugin](https://github.com/spinscale/elasticsearch-ingest-opennlp) can be used to extract keywords that exist **only** within that text, which is not suitable for category extraction. What is needed is a dataset that includes indexable content paired with tags, like an encyclopedia:

1. Index Wikipedia (articles & categories).
2. Use a [More Like This Query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-mlt-query.html) to find documents (wiki articles) that match a given text.
3. Return the categories of the highest scoring documents.
